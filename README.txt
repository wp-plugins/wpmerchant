A simple and powerful way to make money today by selling anything on your website.

== Description ==
We built WPMerchant so that anyone can use our simple and innovative technology to sell their products online; so that anyone can start making money today by selling products/widgets/etc on their website; so that your customers can have the quickest possible fully integrated purchase flow; and so that you don't have to pay $300, $400, or $500+ per year to keep your premium extensions updated. WPMerchant is the quickest, easiest and most effective way to create an online store that produces sales. 

= Simplicty in Everything =
We try to simplify the whole process; from connecting to payment processors and mailing list providers, to creating products, to managing products, to managing orders, to analyzing sales, to increasing sales, etc.  We want to make your life easier than all of the other eCommerce plugins and platforms out there.  We are always striving to simplify; [shoot us over any ideas you may have](http://www.wpmerchant.com).

Check out a working example of a WPMerchant powered site at [TemplateLauncher.com](http://www.templatelauncher.com/services). Click on the BUY NOW button under the PAID LAUNCH column. This is a real site and it is listed here as a live demo of our product; so don't enter in your credit card information unless you actually want to buy the product.  

This version of WPMerchant provides the following features:
* One Click Ordering for your customers
* Create, Edit and Sell Products and/or Product Bundles on your website.
* One Click Connect to your Payment Processor (ie Stripe; specifically Stripe Checkout)
* One Click Connect to your Mailing List Provider (ie MailChimp)
* Subscribe users to a MailChimp list on successful purchase
* Redirect a user to a Thank you apge after checkout or display a custom message to customer on successful purchase
* [Check out our site for our full feature list](http://www.wpmerchant.com).

= Simple One Click Checkout for Customers =
Customers don't have to use the outdated flow of adding an item to a cart, viewing the cart, and then finally proceeding to checkout - geesh.  We make our customer checkout process as simple as possible to give you a better chance at converting a lead into a sale! With one click, your customer can purchase a single product, multiple products or a product bundle.  As such, your customers can check out much faster than on competing eCommerce plugins - which means the money gets into your pocket fast.  

= Best in Class Setup Process =
We pride ourselves on providing the easiest on-boarding experience of any eCommerce plugin. You can connect to a payment processor (ie Stripe) or a mailing list provider (ie MailChimp) using your credentials instead of searching for API Keys (leave that junk to us!).  

= Fully Integrated Payment Processor =
We want your site to be taken seriously and to look as professional as possible.  Therefore, while our competitors offer product checkout through offsite payment providers for free, we are providing you with a FREE fully integrated and simple payment processor (specifically Stripe Checkout).  This means that your customers never leave your site; which makes it incredibly easy for them to purchase your product(s) immediately. 

= Mailing List Integration =
When a product is purchased, your customer is charged for that product and is automatically subscribed to the MailChimp list that you provide.  

= Growth Tips =
We're passionate about helping you find leads and convert those leads into sales. We'll share our tips and tricks to getting more traffic to your site and to analyzing that traffic to get more sales.  In addition to extensive experience building websites (on WordPress and in custom environments) for clients and for ourselves, we founded a company called [TemplateLauncher](https://www.templatelauncher.com) that focuses on building high end landing pages for LeadPages.net customers.  We want to help anyone improve their sales funnel to get more leads and to get more sales. We might give you a free landing page if you're lucky!

= Service Oriented =
We make customer service a priority.  If you have a problem, you can send us a service request through the plugin. If you can't find where to submit it, send it [here](http://www.wpmerchant.com).

= Premium Versions at a Lower Cost =
Sick of paying $200, $300, $400, $500+ dollars every year on updating extensions with other eCommerce plugins. 
We offer additional premium versions of WPMerchant at much more affordable prices than our competitors.  These paid versions support [custom payment form integration](http://www.wpmerchant.com/ "Start making money by simply and professionally selling anything on your website") (we offer Stripe and MailChimp as well as other payment processors and mailing list providers), [the ability to sell Subscriptions](http://www.wpmerchant.com/ "Start making money by simply and professionally selling anything on your website"), [the creation of Membership sites](http://www.wpmerchant.com/ "Start making money by simply and professionally selling anything on your website"), [Marketplace sites](http://www.wpmerchant.com/ "Start making money by simply and professionally selling anything on your website"), and much more.  

If you have a feature suggestion, shoot it on over, we'd love to hear it!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are the fees associated with the payment processor? =

2.9% + 30 cents per transaction.  The same as any other Stripe integration.  We don't take any cut - we want you to get as much money as you can, so you can grow your online store. 

= What payment processor do you use? =

Stripe

= What mailing list provider do you use? =

MailChimp

= Can I redirect a user to a Thank you page after product purchase? =

Yes.  You can create a page in WordPress and enter in the URL to that page in the WPMerchant settings.  You can also provide a message to your customer that is shown in a pop up modal.

= How do I edit the message displayed to the user after successful purchase? =

Go to WPMerchant settings and change the Thank You Message to what you want it to be.  We'll likely change the width but at the moment keep it super short so that it fits within the message container.
